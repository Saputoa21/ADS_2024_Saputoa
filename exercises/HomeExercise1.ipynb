            "When a banana duct-taped to a wall sold for $120,000 in 2019, social media uproar and an age-old debate about the meaning of art ensued.\n",
            "\n",
            "But artist Maurizio Cattelan’s viral creation, titled “Comedian,” may yet prove a sound investment: On Friday, auction house Sotheby’s announced that one of the artwork’s three “editions” is going back on sale — this time with an estimate of $1 million to $1.5 million.\n",
            "\n",
            "For their money, the winning bidder will receive a roll of duct tape and one banana, as well as a certificate of authenticity and official instructions for installing the work. Sotheby’s confirmed to CNN that neither the tape nor, thankfully, the banana are the originals.\n",
            "\n",
            "“‘Comedian’ is a conceptual artwork, and the actual physical materials are replaced with every installation,” an auction spokesperson said via email.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cattelan and French art gallery Perrotin made headlines around the world five years ago when they displayed “Comedian” with a six-figure asking price at the Art Basel Miami Beach fair. The original was created using a banana bought in a Miami grocery store, though the gallery said it could be replaced, as per the artist’s instructions.\n",
            "\n",
            "The art world was split on the work’s merits, though some critics saw it as rooted in the rich tradition of conceptual works — dating back to Marcel Duchamp’s famous mounted urinal — that question the value of art itself. Crowds soon formed, with fair attendees lining up to see the viral installation.\n",

            "\n",
            "Events took an unexpected turn when performance artist David Datuna grabbed the banana from the wall, before peeling and eating it in front of hundreds of stunned fair attendees. He later defended the move as an artistic performance in its own right, not an act of vandalism.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Miami installation was eventually removed amid public safety concerns, but all three editions were sold at the fair. Two were bought by private collectors for $120,000, while the third was purchased for a higher (but undisclosed) sum, and was later donated to The Guggenheim museum in New York.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sotheby’s would not reveal the identity of the seller in November’s auction, but said the work’s current owner had acquired it from the collection of one of the original buyers.\n",
            "\n",
            "In interviews given since the Miami installation, Cattelan has described “Comedian” as a work of commentary. Speaking to the Art Newspaper in 2021 he said it was “not a joke,” calling the viral installation “a reflection on what we value.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The Italian artist, who is known for satirical pieces that challenge popular culture, did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment about November’s sale.\n",

            "\n",
            "In a press release announcing the sale, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art for the Americas, David Galperin, described “Comedian” as a “defiant work of pure genius.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Balancing profound critical thought and subversive wit, this is a defining work for the artist and for our generation,” Galperin said, adding: “If at its core, ‘Comedian’ questions the very notion of the value of art, then putting the work at auction… will be the ultimate realization of its essential conceptual idea — the public will finally have a say in deciding its true value.”\n",
            "\n",
            "While this marks the first time “Comedian” will appear at auction, the work was recently exhibited at the Leeum Museum of Art in Seoul, South Korea. It was eaten then, too: An art student from Seoul National University removed the fruit and devoured it, before taping the peel back to the wall.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The student told the museum he ate it because he was hungry,” a gallery spokesperson told CNN after the 2023 incident. The museum later replaced the eaten banana with a fresh one.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sotheby’s intends to exhibit the artwork ahead of the sale, which takes place at the auction house’s New York headquarters on November 20. “Comedian” will be put on show there on Monday before it embarks on a world tour stopping in London, Paris, Milan, Hong Kong, Dubai, Taipei, Tokyo and Los Angeles.\n"

            "В Берлине прошел белорусский фестиваль интелектуальной книги Pradmova. В дискуссии \"Песни любви и ненависти\", которая состоялась 19 октября, приняла участие и лауреат Нобелевской премии по литературе Светлана Алексиевич. После мероприятия писательница рассказала DW, что не так сделали белорусские элиты в 2020 году и жалеет ли она, что белорусы не применили силу в тот период.\n",

            "\n",
            "Светлана Алексиевич: Я же тоже элита. Мы были в большой неожиданности, мы не ожидали такого выхода народа. Мы не ожидали, что наши люди способны на это. Я помню, как незадолго до маршей в кругу друзей у меня дома говорили, что нет, наш народ спит, ничего невозможно. Когда были марши, я шла тоже с людьми, и там стояла девочка, видно студентка, с плакатом \"Дорогие белорусы, простите меня, я в вас не верила и хотела уехать\". Вот такой был прекрасный плакат, я его запомнила.\n",
            "\n",
            "Мы не ожидали этих событий, и мы шли вслед за событиями. Это был просто праздник, просто шествие - как нас много, какие мы хорошие, какие мы красивые, и будущее рядом. А все оказалось жестче.\n",

            "\n",
            "- Шансов не было, поскольку рядом был наготове Путин. Но все-таки мы и себе показали: стали нацией, как сейчас часто говорят, и миру показали, что необязательно с кровью чего-то добиваться. Я была из тех, кто так думал. Потому что я представляла: если эта техника, которую я вижу по утрам, выползет из своих подворотен, то кто погибнет первым? Студенты, молодые люди. И я не могу сказать \"Пойдемте\". Нет, я не была из тех людей, кто мог позвать на кровь.\n",
            "\n",
            "- То есть несмотря на то, что мы не добились своей цели, вы считаете, что все равно нельзя сказать, что мы проиграли?\n",
            "\n",
            "- Нельзя сказать, что мы проиграли. Мы стали другими. Мир стал смотреть на нас другими глазами. Это очень много значит. После исторической травмы, после драмы, когда сотни людей унижены, их прогнали через тюрьму - несмотря на это, память о том августе будет сохранять наше достоинство очень долго. Это останется в истории.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Главной темой сегодняшней дискуссии была любовь. Андрей Хаданович спросил у Альгерда Бахаревича, не было ли у него при написании его литературы желания отомстить. Он вспомнил знаменитую фразу во время протестов \"Не забудем, не простим\". Это плохо - не прощать и не забывать? Или это необходимо?\n",
            "\n",
            "- У меня тоже в книге есть глава о том, как мы будем жить с теми, кто сегодня издевается над нами в тюрьмах, на площадях, когда хватают людей. В домах, когда сына не успеют найти, так мать ставят на колени и четыре часа она стоит на коленях, пока делают обыск. Как мы будем с этими людьми жить? Это большая проблема. Но ненависть не даст нам будущего. Будущее, конечно, за любовью, как сейчас говорят. За этим таким пока еще не очень надежным словом. Пока еще нет у него почвы.\n",

            "- Это значит проработать, осмыслить, отрефлексировать. И конкретных виновников наказать. Но не \"сосед на соседа\" и гражданская война. Я очень боюсь гражданской войны, это не выход.\n",

            "\n",
            "- Я думаю, что этот опыт должен дать нам силы для нового рождения. Каждый должен продумать себя, продумать будущее. Потому что если мы, как это обычно делаем, остаемся в ловушке этого вселенского плача, мы не продвигаемся вперед, просто вся жизнь уходит на плач. Это наша старая культура плача. Надо все-таки находить там дух. Когда мне говорят, что я писатель катастроф, я с этим не согласна, потому что я не писатель катастроф. Я собираю здесь человеческий дух: как человеку остаться и стать человеком.\n",

            "- У вас есть совет тем людям, которые несмотря на то, что уже два, три или даже четыре года находятся в эмиграции, не могут привыкнуть к этому новому миру - как им все-таки переродиться, что сделать? Это означает, что надо отпустить старый мир?\n",
            "\n",
            "- Надо поставить себе новые цели: что будет новое время, и я должен стать новым человеком. И иметь цель, получать профессию, знания, смотреть вокруг. Если можно, ездить, учиться миру, который вокруг нас. Этот мир устроен, почему мы не можем устроить свой мир?\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "- Нет, дождемся. Они не победят время. Время нельзя победить. Максимум у них 10 лет. Но я думаю, еще меньше. Все будет зависеть, конечно, от Европы и от тех процессов, которые будут в России. Но пока в России я не вижу силы сопротивления.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Вы говорили про красного человека, что вы уже очень давно его осмысляли и что вам интересно сейчас понять, что дальше происходит с этим человеком. Что вы узнали о нем во время написания нового романа?\n",
            "\n",
            "- Мы говорили, что коммунист умер, красный человек умер, а этот красный человек стреляет в Украину. Наше прошлое стреляет в Украину. Мы не отрефлексировали это, не обдумали.\n"
